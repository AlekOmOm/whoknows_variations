# Flask Variations

# Merging:

Use the `ours` merge strategy to merge the `main` branch into the `new-branch` branch. only update the `main` branch.

Merging into `main` branch example:

```bash
git checkout new-branch
git merge -s ours main
```

## How to get started

Each branch is a tutorial in a different topic based on the same Flask application as in the `main` branch. 

One way to follow along is by:

1. Forking the repository to your own account.

2. Cloning the repository to your local machine.

3. Checking out the branch you are interested in (e.g. `git checkout <branch-name>`).

4. Following the instructions in the README of the branch.

5. You can now push changes to your own repository.
